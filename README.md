# url-shortner


1. Clone the repository by running the below command:
git clone https://github.com/sarat07/url-shortner.git ./<workspace>
2. Execute permissions for start.sh script by running the below command:
chmod +x start.sh
3. run the start script by running the below command:
./start.sh

This will start both the front end and back end apps and it should open the app automatically at localhost:3000. 

The following are the tech stack:
Frontend - React, Typescript, Html and CSS.
Backend - Express(Node), Typescript, Mangoose and Mongo DB.

What can the app do?
1. Enter any valid url and it will shorten.
2. Invalid urls will not be allowed.
3. All the shortened urls are displayed in the page as a list.
4. Ability to copy the shortened url.
5. Delete a url.
6. Success and error messages handling.

I tried to set this up on docker but ran into some issues with Vite and didnt want to delay the submission further.
